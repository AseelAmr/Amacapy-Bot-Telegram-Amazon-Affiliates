<h1>Amacapy</h1>
<p>Amacapy is a software that does web scraping to the Amazon website and publishes them on Telegram, searches the products by the keyword entered or the direct link of the product. Then you can publish these products on Telegram in a certain time. The technologies used were PyQT5, Beautiful Soup and Python.</p>

<h2>How does Amacapy work?</h2>
<p>Amacapy needs your Amazon ID (Affiliate Tag), the Token of the Telegram Bot created with Bot Father and the Chat ID of the Telegram group or channel.</p>

<p>Amacapy works for Amazon USA, Amazon Spain and Amazon Italy.	</p>

<h3>You can search by keyword or by placing the direct link of the product (without the affiliate tag).</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the search engine you must enter a keyword of a product you are interested in and when you search for it, in a few minutes it will give you a result with the list of products found.</li>
<li>You can also place the direct link to the product, but you must place it without the affiliate tag.</li>
</ul>

<p> Some products that appear with price "0" is because it is a variable product and contains several prices. You can click on the "view" button (the little eye), look at the price, choose the one that suits you and place it in the program. </p>

<p> Once you have the list of search results, delete the products you do not want to publish and click on the "Add Products" button.</p>
